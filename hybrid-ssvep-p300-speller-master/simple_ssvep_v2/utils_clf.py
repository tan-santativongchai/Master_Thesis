        EEG data to be processed

    sfreq: int
        Sampling frequency of the data.

    idx_fb: int
        Index of filters in filter bank analysis

    peaks : list of len (n_classes)
        Frequencies corresponding to the SSVEP components.

    Returns
    -------

    y: np.array, shape (trials, channels, samples)
