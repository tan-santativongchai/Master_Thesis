\chapter{EXPERIMENT}


What you need to discuss:

\section{Feasibility and effectiveness of the consumer-grade EEG}
Yes - it's feasible
yes - it's effective but.....

\section{Long-term viability of the TRCA trained model}
yes, but....

so what depends on?

\section{Why some participants are better or worst?}
sdfsfsdf

\section{Guidelines}
tell us 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, what people need to do...

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Don't use FBCCA because ....
    \item Use GEl 
    \item 
\end{enumerate}

\section{implications}
so what do you think - can we use consumer grade EEG for patients? 
- yes, if the target is not much....
- it mean it can use to support lower command application
- for example, move left, right down, group based speller - 12 groups of letters

\section{Limitation and future work}
what your study is limited, and possible future work
- why you don't do more than 16 targets, should your future master juniors do this....or something else....
